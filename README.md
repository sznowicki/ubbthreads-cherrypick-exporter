# Ubbthreads cherrypick exporter
Exports ubbthreads (old php forum software) topics and posts with related data to mongodb documents.
## Current status
Kind of working state. 
## Why there’s nodebb importer
I decided to extend this repo with this small little importer to  avoid creating another repo for this process (some code is shared but should not be independent npm as well).
Feel free to create your own importer for something else and add it to this repo if it would be small.
## Further development
Keep in mind this is one time job. Don’t expect constant development, but feel free to fork it for your own needs or make it better by creating pull requests. 
Also I’d be happy to answer your questions or support you if something goes wrong.
I spent couple of weeks over my free time to import things from ubb to nodebb and I kind of know almost everything about latin1, latin2, php4 software incompatibilities and all the other things I didn’t want to know but are somehow related with this topic.
